        <h1>A little about me:</h1>
        <blockquote>
            My name is Scott Baron. I was a manager at a medium sized manufacturing company for 5 years prior to Georgian College. At that job
            I began using Excel to organized and increase efficency. Over a year or so, once I really got into Excel, I began making 
            extremely complicated spreadsheets which cut the time commitment of certain jobs from literal hours to seconds. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I eventually reached the natural limits of Excel and decided programming was what I wanted to do for a living moving forward. Here I am.
